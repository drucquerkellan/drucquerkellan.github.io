    <p style="font-size:20px">Looks like you've stumbled upon my portfolio. This is more of an anti-procrastinating thing for me, to not only motivate me to accomplish things, but so I can see what I've done and keep track of it. I also really needed some CSS practice and this seemed like a great opportunity. Anyway, feel free to look around and see if you find anything you like.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center">About Me</h3>
    <p style="font-size:20px">Hello world. I'm Kellan, a freshman in highschool. Yes, I am young. No, that picture up there is <u>not</u> what I look like in real life. That would just be creepy. I thoroughly enjoy coding and design, although my skills could definitely use some work. I'm also a diehard Linux / Android fan, although I try to keep an open mind when I can. Hmm...what else. Oh I like to write, and I have a pretty extreme case of grammar / spelling Nazi-ism. When I'm not obsessing over one of the aforementioned subjects / hobbies, I'm either with friends or asleep under the covers. Well, I think that's enough talk for now. I now direct you to the next section.</p>
